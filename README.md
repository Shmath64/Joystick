#Arduino Joystick
Very simple Arduino sketch and Python script to map joystick actions to keystrokes on a laptop using the serial monitor.
To make this project on your own, make sure your joystick is of the type that has 5 pins (GND, +5V, VRx, VRy and SW)
Work in progress, hoping to add a simple GUI that will allow remapping the inputs without editing any code.
